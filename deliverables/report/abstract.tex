\noindent\textbf{Abstract}

This project investigates the geometric and photometric properties of a rectangular parallelepiped observed in a single image taken by an uncalibrated, zero-skew camera. 
The furniture piece has a known width, while its depth and height are to be determined. 
The image features include a set of parallel lines, as well as projections of a horizontal circumference and an unknown planar curve at mid-height.
Theoretical steps involve identifying the vanishing line of the horizontal plane, performing Euclidean rectification, estimating the parallelepipedâ€™s dimensions, computing the calibration matrix, and reconstructing the unknown curve in 3D. 
A MATLAB implementation is provided to extract features, apply theoretical methods, and visualize the reconstructed 3D model.
